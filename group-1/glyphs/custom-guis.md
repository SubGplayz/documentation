# Custom GUIs

To create a custom GUI, you need two things; the texture and a plugin for the GUI.

### Creating the GUI texture

Okay, so firstly, we need to create the texture and add it as a glyph to Oraxen. One thing you need to make sure you have done is position the GUI correctly in the .png file that will have the custom gui. I have supplied templates for 1 - 6 line GUIs so that you do not have to struggle.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="1 row" %}


Coming soon
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="2 rows" %}


Coming soon
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="3 rows" %}
![](../../.gitbook/assets/3-rows.png)
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="4 rows" %}


Coming soon
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="5 rows" %}
Coming soon
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="6 rows" %}
Coming soon
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

In this tutorial however I am going to be using a 3 row GUI which is equivalent to a single chest. Now that you have chosen the GUI size, it is time to make the actual texture.&#x20;

There is a selection of different software I would recommend for texturing, and they are the following:

* Aseprite (Paid)
